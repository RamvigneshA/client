## Features

**Book Management:**
- Add new books
- Edit existing books
- Delete books
- Update books

## How it Works
**Frontend:**

The React frontend handles user interactions, displays books, and sends requests to the backend API.
The frontend uses the axios library to make API requests to the backend.

**Backend:**

The Node.js and Express.js backend handles API requests, database interactions, and authentication.
The backend uses a database (MySQL in this case) to store book information and user data.
API endpoints are defined for CRUD operations on books and user authentication.



## Technology Stack
**Frontend:** React

**Backend:** Node.js and Express.js

**Database:** MySQL
